Evolution of e-Commerce and Consumers' Behavior to Forecast Future e-Commerce Trends

1.0 OBJECTIVES

- To Investigate and analyze the customersâ€™ behaviors on the e-commerce platform. This includes understanding purchasing patterns, identifying top contributor elements for sales and predicting customer preferences.
- To evaluate the most suitable analysis methodology that best suited the target business and further aid the decision making. This will help the businesses to understand the consumer practicality and produce business strategy.
- To develop predictive models to forecast product demand based on historical data that will aid in optimizing inventory management for future sales.

2.0 RESULT AND CONCLUSION

By performing feature importance analysis, Length of Membership have highest impact on Yearly Amount Spent by 0.79. While Time Spent on website and app have second highest impack on Yearly Amount Spent by 0.21.

For modeling result, 

Accuracy:
- Decision Tree Regressor: 62.84%
- Multiple Linear Regressor: 72.88%

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
- Decision Tree Regressor: 48.399
- Multipple Linear Regressor: 41.343

Based on evaluation metrics, Multiple Linear Regression model shows better performance than the Decision Tree Regressor in this scenario.

3.0 FUTURE WORK/RECOMMENDATION

1. Emphasize customer retention and loyalty programs by giving offer exclusive benefits,rewords, or incentives for long-term members to enhance their loyalty in memberships and increase their spending over time.
2. Implement Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning and deploy the model to further monitor customer's behaviour, track the effectiveness of implemented strategies, and interatively refine marketing, user experience and loyalty programs.
